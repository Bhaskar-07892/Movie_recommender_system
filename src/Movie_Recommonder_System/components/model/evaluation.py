# evaluation.py
# This module will contain evaluation logic for the movie recommender system.
# Currently, it's a placeholder for future implementation.

"""
Planned Features:

1. Evaluation Metrics:
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1-Score
    - Accuracy (if applicable)
    - Mean Average Precision (MAP)

2. Validation Methods:
    - Cross-validation for recommender systems
    - Train/test split based on timestamps (if using implicit feedback)

3. Feedback System:
    - User can give feedback like: Like / Unlike
    - Based on feedback, system can log performance or adjust weights later

4.  Future Improvements:
    - Personalized recommendations based on user behavior
    - Active learning to improve cold-start recommendations
